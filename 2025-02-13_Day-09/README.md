# Expense Tracker in TypeScript

An Expense Tracker is a simple application that allows users to log, categorize, and view their expenses. It's a great TypeScript project because it involves working with types, state management, and local storage.

**Features:**

- ✔️ Add new expenses (amount, category, date, description).
- ✔️ Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Bills, Shopping, etc.).
- ✔️ View expense history.
- ✔️ Store data in local storage so it persists after refreshing the page.
- ✔️ Filter expenses by category or date range.

**How TypeScript Helps in This Project**

- 🔹 **Interfaces for expense data:** Define a strict structure for expense entries.
- 🔹 **Enums for categories:** Prevent invalid expense categories.
- 🔹 **Strongly-typed state management:** Ensures expenses are handled correctly.
